React Project Setup

This project uses React and is designed to run locally on your machine. Follow the steps below to install the dependencies and start the development server.

Getting started
	1.	Install dependencies
Before running the application, you need to install the project dependencies using npm: npm i

    2.	Start the development server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with: npm run dev

This command runs the app in development mode. Open your browser at the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173/) to view it. Any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the page.

That’s it! You now have the project running locally. If you encounter issues, ensure your version of Node.js matches the project’s requirements defined in package.json.
